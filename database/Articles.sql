(4, 'Netflix&#8217;s Army of Thieves &#038; Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin Leak to Pirate Sites', ' Home   &gt; Piracy   &gt;\n\n    Army of Thieves will premiere on Netflix this Friday, hoping to follow emulate the success of Army of the Dead. While millions will watch legally, pirates have already jumped ahead of the game. In the past few hours, a very good copy landed on pirate sites. It was followed by high-quality leaks of Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin, Apex and Lamb.   Making movies readily available on official streaming services was supposed to be the silver bullet for defeating piracy, but these things aren&#8217;t always so straightforward.\n\nTo improve the chances of success, subscriptions also need to be priced fairly and when movies come out, there should be no sitting around waiting for a piracy-encouraging theatrical window to close.\n\nAll of these elements formed part of the plan when Netflix delivered Zack Snyder&#8217;s Army of the Dead back in May. Readily accessible, reasonably priced, with a very small gap between theatrical release and streaming debut, things appeared to go smoothly.\n\nThis October 29th, Netflix will release Army of Thieves, the prequel to Army of the Dead. It will tick all of the piracy-defeating boxes of the first installment but that hasn&#8217;t prevented the movie from leaking online. Army of Thieves Appears on Pirate Sites\n\nA few hours ago, rumors began circulating that Army of Thieves had leaked online, days ahead of its Netflix release. Comments indicated that this is a very good copy and not something culled from a grainy physical or online source. It’s now confirmed that the movie has indeed leaked in 1080p, with one release labeled as a WEBRip and the other a much more sought-after WEB-DL.\n\nThe latter is usually preferred since these are digital files downloaded from streaming services, not lower-quality screen captures produced locally. It&#8217;s a little early to say for sure but the rumors of decent quality are likely to be true, as per the leaked screenshots below.\n\nBut just like London buses, you wait for one leak and then several others come all at once. Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin&#8230;and More\n\nIn the wake of Army Of Thieves, several other movies leaked to torrent and streaming sites, mostly ahead of their official release dates. Again, all appear to have been released in WEB-DL and/or WEBRip qualities.\n\nAs the seventh installment and a reboot of the Paranormal Activity series, Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin was set for a theatrical release in March 2021 but the coronavirus pandemic pushed that out to March 2022.\n\nEarlier this year it was announced that the film will be released exclusively on Paramount+ on October 29th but that has now been trumped by pirates, who leaked the movie a few hours ago. Again, quality appears good.\n\nIcelandic drama film Lamb premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was released in Iceland on September 24. The movie began a limited theatrical release on October 8 in the US but viewers in countries around Europe could be waiting until January 2022 to watch legally. Those who prefer not to wait now have another option, however.\n\nFinally, pirates also leaked the new Bruce Willis movie &#8216;Apex&#8216; in the past few hours. The action-thriller is set to have a day-and-date release on November 12 but yet again, pirates have gone one better, this time by a couple of weeks.\n\nWhile the leaks are controversial enough, they are made more interesting by the fact that a single shadowy and prolific group has taken responsibility for them all. P2P Release Group EVO Strikes Again\n\nTo give just a handful of examples, during October last year P2P release group EVO leaked screener copies of the movies Falling and My Salinger Year online. This September, EVO was also responsible for leaking Netflix movies The Power of the Dog and The Guilty, which were apparently ripped from festival screeners.\n\nThen, several days before the new Dune movie was set to enjoy its US release on HBO Max this month, EVO leaked a copy of that too. This week they are responsible for leaking several more, including Army of Thieves, something that Netflix is unlikely to be happy about. Times Have Changed and The Leak May Not Cause Chaos\n\nWhile there is little doubt that Army of the Dead fans will be enthusiastic about watching the prequel, pre-release leaks of movies set to appear on Netflix probably avoid many of the problems experienced by others with more complex release models, such as Lamb.\n\nFirstly, Netflix has more than 200 million subscribers and when households and account sharing are taken into consideration, the reach of the platform is significantly more than that. As a result, all of the customers that were intending to watch the movie on Friday can still do so, without resorting to piracy. The other bonus is that there is no theatrical window to disrupt or destroy.\n\nWhile its model offers some protection, the downside for Netflix is that new movie releases can be a magnet for new subscribers. The leak probably won&#8217;t do too much damage in that respect but Netflix has become much more aggressive on the piracy front in recent times, so could yet have the last say.

How are Open Source communities supposed to check? What if a program that is included in another Open Source program makes an update that adds illegal functionality?&#8221; Alex asks.\n\n&#8220;We definitely think that Open Source developers shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about this, because frankly, they can&#8217;t possibly check thousands of lines of code for every software and update they include.

(7, 'US Copyright Foe to Address Piracy, But Won&#8217;t Restrict Citizens&#8217; Freedom', ' Home   &gt; Piracy   &gt;\n\n    Ukraine, former home of Demonoid and current home to many torrent and similar file-sharing sites, has been subjected to regular criticism by the United States over copyright. This year the U.S. went further still, listing Ukraine as a priority in its Special 301 report and opening up the country to sanctions. Now Ukraine says it will address its online piracy problems, but states that it will not deny its citizens their right to freely access information.   Every year the United States government produces its Special 301 report. Prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the report identifies countries which are under-performing on issues such as intellectual property protection.\n\nAfter being present on the standard &#8216;Watch List&#8217; in 2011, Ukraine found itself upgraded to the Priority Watch List in 2012. The United States complained that Ukraine had done little to address counterfeiting and piracy and in some cases had actually taken steps backwards, such as when it took down large file-hosting site EX.ua and then allowed it to reopen days later. The U.S. said that Ukraine had also failed to introduce a formal notice-and-takedown regime.\n\nBy 2013 things had failed to improve, in fact so much so that in May Ukraine was designated a Priority Foreign Country by the USTR, meaning that the United States government could impose trade sanctions.\n\n&#8220;This designation is the culmination of several years of growing concern over widespread\r\n IP theft, including the growing entrenchment of IPR infringement that is facilitated by government actors,&#8221; the damning report read.\n\nAmid an extremely long list of criticisms, the USTR said Ukraine needed to establish a &#8220;predictable and transparent system&#8221; to combat online piracy, including consultation with rightsholders, legal reform, and deterrent-level sentences for infringement.\n\nNow, three months after its 301 disaster, the Ukranian government says it&#8217;s prepared to address its online piracy issues.\n\n&#8220;Today, all countries have to solve a complex dilemma between the free dissemination of information and the violation of intellectual property rights. Many are forced to take legislative measures against piracy on the Internet,&#8221; says Volodymyr Seminozhenko, head of Ukraine&#8217;s State Agency on Science, Innovations and Information.\n\n&#8220;It is logical, because with more rapid development of information technology general Internet users are able to share any audio visual material, texts or computer programs online. It is clear that among the array of information available will be pirated content, which naturally causes concern to rightsholders.&#8221;\n\nSeminozhenko, a former Vice Premier Minister of Ukraine and current head of the Association of Ukrainian Scientists, says that a similar law to the one just implemented by Russia is being prepared by the State Intellectual Property Service.\n\nHowever, having seen the backlash over Russia&#8217;s site and content blocking provisions (and a failure to properly engage the information technology sector when preparing legislation) it seems likely that Ukraine will tread more cautiously.\n\n&#8220;The status quo on this complex issue can only be achieved when taking into account all stakeholders &#8211; that includes rightsholders, representatives of the IT community, and users of the network. The fact that such a compromise is necessary is confirmed by the recent events surrounding the Russian anti-piracy law,&#8221; the minister adds.\n\nSemynozhenko has worked hard for more than a decade promoting innovation and a thriving business environment in Ukraine and says that in any regime the interests of citizens should be paramount, including their right to freely access information.\n\n&#8220;Fighting Internet piracy should not create artificial conditions for blocking of Internet resources that are fully transparent and legitimate, and even more so should not restrict the freedom of citizens to access information,&#8221; Seminozhenko says.\n\nThe exact system Ukraine has mind is still not finalized, but there are suggestions that current law will be amended to allow rightsholders to file complaints against pirate sites with the State Intellectual Property Service. Within 10 days of receipt of the complaint an investigation will be launched to determine if content is indeed online illegally.\n\nIn the final step &#8211; and one likely to cause controversy if it&#8217;s pushed through &#8211; there are suggestions that those putting content online illegally will be required to pay some kind of fee for the items listed in copyright complaints, with the money raised being transferred directly into state coffers.\n\nSince the USTR has already criticized the Ukranian government for allowing &#8220;rogue&#8221; music collection societies to operate freely in the country (even going as far as stating that one such outfit has &#8220;strong ties&#8221; to government officials), further enrichment of the state at the expense of copyright holders isn&#8217;t likely to be well received.\n\nOnly time will tell if the reforms will be enough to downgrade Ukraine in the 2014 Special 301 report, or if they will be viewed by the U.S. as a day late and a dollar short.

(10, 'Prenda Spoofs Identity, Wants Bad Publicity Gone', ' Earlier today we reported on how the group collectively refereed to as &#8216;Prenda&#8217; (despite having reformed under a plethora of other names, and Prenda wound down) were not only seeding the files they were suing over, but actually uploaded them to The Pirate Bay. But that wasn&#8217;t the only interesting thing in that filing.\n\nThere’s more in this cracking filing (Number 61 on the docket) though, including some more fun over the Alan Cooper business. For those that don’t know, Alan Cooper is the name of one of the principles in the case who has signed a lot of the copyright paperwork. It’s ALSO the name of John Steele’s former caretaker, who has sued over having his identity stolen, to which Prenda counter-sued\n\nIn the exhibits filed there are some nice audio snippets featuring conversations with GoDaddy. Included in there are some people claiming to be John Steele, and in one (PDF with embedded audio), the same voice is calling himself Alan Cooper.\n\nIs it any wonder that Alan Cooper sued for fraudulent use of his name?\n\nThere’s also audio of Steele trying to fix his site when a javascript redirect sent visitors along to the Pirate Bay, sounding rather worried and being admonished that he needed to keep his sites software (mainly wordpress) up to date.\n\nThis filing comes hard on the heels of a motion by Prenda’s Craigslist-advertising Georgia counsel, Jacques Nazaire, the day before. In Nazaire’s motion, also heavy with exhibits, he shows upset at the discovery undertaken by the defense (some of which we’ve just talked about) as well as the public comments on the case, including comments by the two other people appearing before the judge that day – Defense attorney Blair Chintella, and his expert witness Andrew Norton (Disclosure, Mr Norton is TorrentFreak’s researcher and community manager, better known as K`Tetch).\n\nMr Nazaire included posts describing the July 2nd hearing, where discovery was granted, by those two, plus comments on Techdirt, popehat, and fightcopyrighttrolls (although in those last three, the article itself was not included), all as part of a request to put the case under seal, meaning nothing further in the case would be public. His reason was as follows. \n\nAdditionally, the Plaintiff is respectfully requesting that any future filings in this case may be filed under seal. This case has generated much unneeded attention on the internet. Please see Exhibits N-S. While the writers listed in exhibits N-S have the right to post these articles, unfortunately, these articles and blogs have created an embarrassment, misleading characterizations and perhaps an unsafe environment for plaintiff’s counsel and third parties. As such, plaintiff is respectfully requesting that all future filings be permitted to be made under seal.\n\nThe embarrassment is mainly due to an earlier filing in the case, where Mr Nazaire suggested that the court ignore Judge Wright’s Star Trek order, because states have different laws, just like California allows Gay marriage, and Georgia doesn’t. In the same filing, he also alluded to the EFF being terrorists, and how Mr Chintella was a member, presumably to sway the 83yo judge who sat on the FISA court in the 1980s. It didn’t work.\n\nLikewise the unsafe environment argument was reportedly shot down at the hearing, when Mr Nazaire was asked why some of the contact details on the original complaint were not his, but those of Brett Gibbs, at that time Prenda’s local counsel in California. This is a big no-no under Federal rules, and the threatening behaviour Mr Nazaire was worried about? A single mocking email, he admitted to the court; we at TorrentFreak get trolled more by Piracy fans…\n\nHe has since doubled-down on these arguments as well, filing this morning that any sort of discourse or discussion (as required by law for certain things) is impossible, because \n\nThe telephone and live conversations will more than likely be taped and played on the internet. The confidential matters discussed via email will more than likely be posted as a publicity campaign on the internet.\n\nIt&#8217;s a reiteration of a claim made by Nazaire to the judge in the hearing &#8211; that of the poor bullied lawyer &#8211; and was dismissed by the judge at the time. Unfortunately it&#8217;s a technique they are too well associated with, having basically bullied thousands of defendants into paying settlements, or else have their names &#8216;posted as a publicity campaign on the Internet&#8217;.\n\nWhile the evidence in so far is convincing, it’s by no means conclusive. Discovery won’t end until September 5th, so there’s bound to be more revelations. However, few can probably be as disturbing as the thought of a lawyer having steelefamilylaw.com on one hand, and trannyboyswholovetheirtoys.com on the other.

In addition, GitHub pages can also be used as a hosting service for websites. GitHub Removes Unblockit Repo\n\nThe vast majority of GitHub&#8217;s users showcase their work without issues, but not everything is allowed. A few hours ago, the company removed the repository of Unblockit, a popular proxy service that provides access to blocked &#8216;pirate&#8217; sites.\n\nIn addition to the repo, GitHub also removed a mirror of the Unblockit website which was hosted on a dedicated GitHub page.\n\nWhile GitHub regularly removes content in response to DMCA takedown requests, this incident is different. There is no mention of a takedown notice and GitHub informs visitors that the repo was removed due to a violation of its terms of service.\n\nSpeaking with TorrentFreak, a GitHub spokesperson clarifies that the company investigated the repo after a violation was reported. This eventually led to the conclusion that Unblockit should be taken offline.\n\n&#8220;We removed the content following an investigation into a report that it was in violation of our Acceptable Use Policies and Additional Terms for GitHub Pages, which is intended for showcasing personal and organizational projects and not for promoting unrelated sites or services,” GitHub tells us.\n\nThe Unblockit repo (archived) was mainly used to track issues and inform people about domain names changes.

After reaching out to the platform, GitHub said that the reported violations included &#8216;directing traffic to third-party sites&#8217;.\n\nThis type of activity violates GitHub&#8217;s guidelines and, as such, the repository won&#8217;t be restored.\n\n&#8220;Specifically, the content or conduct that was reported included using GitHub Pages solely to direct traffic to third party sites, which we found to be against our guidelines. We will not be reinstating your repository at this time,&#8221; GitHub informed Unblockit.\n\nWe specifically asked the platform whether the repo was flagged by a third party. While we didn&#8217;t receive a direct answer, GitHub repeatedly states that it investigated &#8216;a report,&#8217; which may refer to an external tip.\n\nThere is no mention of any copyright issues or violations but, needless to say, copyright holders will be happy to see this blocking circumvention service being partially taken down.  Unblockit Responds\n\nThe takedown doesn&#8217;t affect the main Unblockit service, which remains available through Unblockit.kim. The GitHub repo did make it easier for some people to spot domain changes, however, which will no longer be an option now.\n\n&#8220;Going forward, these users will simply have to switch to using the main Unblockit domain and use our other social media channels such as Reddit, Telegram, Twitter to stay up to date on updates,&#8221; Unblockit informs TF.\n\nOne advantage of the Unblockit mirror site hosted by GitHub was that it never changed its URL. However, only a relatively small number of people used this, so the service doesn&#8217;t expect it to have a major impact.\n\n&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect there to be much impact on Unblockit since the traffic from the Github URL was not significant. Furthermore, since the launch of the subreddit, we started receiving fewer issue reports to the Github repository as people found it easier to submit issues on the subreddit.&#8221;\n\nAt this time, Unblockit has no plans to relaunch the repository elsewhere. It will focus on the main service instead which, unsurprisingly, is a major target of pirate site blocking efforts itself.  ', ' Ernesto Van der Sar '),
(12, 'Court Forbids IsoHunt From Indexing Dead Torrent Sites', ' Home   &gt; Piracy   &gt;\n\n    A California District Court has updated and clarified the permanent injunction the MPAA won against the BitTorrent search engine isoHunt. The torrent site has to keep filtering movie and TV show-related titles and terms on its site. The new order further prohibits isoHunt from indexing or linking to The Pirate Bay and the late BTJunkie and TorrentSpy. This is the first time that a U.S. court has forbidden a site from linking to other sites that have been dead for years.   In 2010, a California District Court ordered isoHunt to implement a filter to exclude movie and TV show-related terms from its search engine.\n\nDespite running the filter for some time the Canada-based torrent search engine hoped to have the decision overruled on appeal, but in March this year that aim suffered a setback.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit upheld the decision of the lower court. In addition, the court requested that the permanent injunction should be updated to clarify some parts that could be interpreted in multiple ways.\n\nLast month the MPAA and isoHunt legal teams got together to propose a modified injunction, which the court has signed off on last week.\n\nOverall the changes are fairly minimal, and isoHunt is still required to filter its site based on a list of infringing keywords provided by the MPAA. In addition, the BitTorrent site is prohibited from indexing torrents or linking to various other file-sharing sites.\n\nInitially, the injunction held that isoHunt could not index or provide access to &#8220;Dot-torrent or similar files harvested or collected from well-known infringing source sites, such as The Pirate Bay.&#8221;\n\nSince the term &#8220;well-known infringing source sites&#8221; is open to interpretation, this part was updated by naming specific sites.\n\nUnder the new injunction isoHunt is prohibited from &#8220;indexing or providing access to Dot-torrent or similar files harvested or collected from the following sites or services: The Pirate Bay, Torrentspy, BT Junkie, Torrentreactor.net, kat.ph or torrents.net&#8221; No index\n\nWhile it&#8217;s understandable that this language is updated, the inclusion of &#8220;TorrentSpy and BTJunkie&#8221; is peculiar since these sites closed down a long time ago.\n\nTorrentSpy closed down half a decade ago when the MPAA won a $110 million judgment against the site. BTJunkie has been around for longer, but threw in the towel early last year after the Megaupload raid.\n\nNeedless to say, there&#8217;s not much that can be harvested from these sites so isoHunt should have no issues complying with this part of the injunction.\n\nThe injunction does, however, allow the MPAA to request that new sites are added to this list when they have sufficient proof that they&#8217;re infringing. This effectively means that it can severely limit isoHunt&#8217;s sources.\n\nAnother update to the injunction is that isoHunt is prohibited from advertising its services by referring to the following sites: The Pirate Bay, TorrentSpy, Aimster, Kazaa, Grokster, Morpheus, Newzbin, BT Junkie, Torrentreactor.net, kat.ph, torrents.net, SurftheChannel.com, Kino.to, Movie2k.to, and/or Dl4all.com.\n\nAgain we see TorrentSpy and BTJunkie listed, as well as many other defunct services including Kazaa, Grokster and SurftheChannel.com.\n\nOverall the modified injunction doesn&#8217;t change much for isoHunt. However, the MPAA is still pursuing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as well as a motion for contempt, as the movie studios claim that isoHunt&#8217;s filtering software is not working.\n\nAnd so the case continues.

(13, 'Pirate Bay Moderators on Accomplishments, Memories and TPB&#8217;s Future', ' Yesterday The Pirate Bay turned 10 years old.\n\nOver the years many people have spoken out about the site, but we rarely hear from those who do all the dirty work behind the scenes.\n\nThe site&#8217;s moderators and helpers are some of the site&#8217;s most valuable &#8220;assets,&#8221; deleting hundreds of ‘spam’ accounts and fake uploads every day.\n\nWe reached out to some of the mods to hear their thoughts on TPB and SteRipper and Maestral were kind enough to oblige.  SteRipper\n\nSteRipper uploaded his first torrent to The Pirate Bay early 2008 and has since joined the ranks of moderators.\n\nAccomplishments: There are two accomplishments – the first is the fact that The Pirate Bay has stood strong in the face of people who will do anything to make a buck if it will save them from actual doing hard work and changing their outdated views (Hollywood).\n\nA lot of people have tried standing against that before, and have buckled under the stress and pressure of it all. The fact that the Bay has not, and most likely will not happen, is a sight to behold and respect.\n\nThe second accomplishment is that The Pirate Bay Admins understand the importance of making backups. That&#8217;s all that saved this wonderful site from going under. I don&#8217;t even want to imagine what the internet would be like if that didn&#8217;t happen.\n\nMemorable Moments: There are two: The day I became a user of The Pirate Bay, and the day I became a Mod. I first got involved with the site in 2008. I had heard about it from a TV show that talked about it, and the first thing that went through my mind was “What is the Pirate Bay?”. Five minutes after hearing about it, I googled it. A day later, I was downloading from it. A month after that, I was uploading to it.\n\nOver time, I just went up the ladder in the Torrent ecosystem. From Trusted to VIP, and then on to Helper. I was having fun, and enjoying what I was doing, but when I became a Mod, that&#8217;s when it hit me. I knew I was doing well on the Bay, but it didn&#8217;t truly connect with me until I became a TPB moderator. At that moment, I&#8217;d gone from being a porn uploader that helps mods handle bad users when he can, I became a guy that helps those in need on a fantastic website, surrounded by great and wonderful people. When I became a mod, I became part of a second family, who I think the world of.\n\nThe Future: There are some, if not all Anti-Piracy advocates out there, who say that The Pirate Bay&#8217; days are numbered – I and many disagree. Even though it&#8217;s been on the web for a decade, I still believe it&#8217;s in its infancy. There is much room for improvement for the Bay, and I see it doing more than it already is.\n\nI think in the next 10 years, it will be seen as a flagship (even more) to creating and using new technologies in that will evolve the BitTorrent world to new heights. I still see that ship, sailing proudly as it should, more than happy to have people from all walks of life in the world coming aboard and enjoying the vast goodies it&#8217;s users are willing to share with all. Maestral\n\nMaestral has been with The Pirate Bay for more than half a decade and belongs to the core moderator team.\n\nAccomplishments: TPB is unique project in Internet history. It&#8217;s more than a torrent site, especially for staff members. It&#8217;s partnership, or friendship if you like. So many different characters and personalities, and somehow we survive each day together, for the same cause.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, you have some really special people you can turn to even for afk things and help or just talk. That&#8217;s special part of it for me. I believe we manage to pass some of that to users too.\n\nMemorable moments: What I remember the most of everything, I guess Anakata ending up in jail and TPB docus that were released over the years.\n\nThe Future: TPB had few rough patches, but I&#8217;m not afraid for its future, as it stands for freedom of open mind for me. There&#8217;s enough sheep in the world as it is, and TPB showed to some circles out there, that were making rules before, that rules sometimes suck big time, and not everyone is willing to take it as they think we should take it.\n\nThe Bay might not be the prettiest site in the world, but it’s most friendly for sure. That’s something big money can’t understand or ever will. Greets to Anakata, we’re all with you, and happy B-day The Pirate Bay!  ', ' Ernesto Van der Sar ');
